## Pieps' Discord log bot

Small .NET Core bot that stores logs serverside and allows guild members to query them. Required dependencies
can be installed using NuGet and are found in the using directives.

If you use dotnet CLI, create a new console project then use provided source.

## Requirements
Two packages that can both be found in the NuGet index:
* [Discord .NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
* [NewtonSoft Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)

And .NET Core SDK v3.1.201. Probably but not guaranteed to be cross platform.
